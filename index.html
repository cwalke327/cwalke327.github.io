Welcome to Cheyanne Walker's web site!

<p> 
  <body>Hello! I'm Cheyanne Walker. Welcome to my digital home. Cheyanne Walker is a proud graduate of the University of West Georgia with a journalism major and marketing minor.

While in college, she worked as an anchor for the University of West Georgiaâ€™s news station, WUTV, covering sporting and community events for two years.

When she wasn't anchoring the news, she was an investigative journalist for the University of West Georgia's radio show, The College Circuit.

In her spare time, Cheyanne enjoys hanging out with family and friends, playing the piano, and serving up a tough game of volleyball. She volunteers with the United One Foundation by assisting high school students with their SAT, ACT, 

and/or GED testing registration, organizing college fairs, and organizing career fairs.<body>
